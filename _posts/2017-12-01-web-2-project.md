## About
* Developed a checkpoint marking system.
* Two modes - students and admin.
* Teacher can view all students previous records, check scatter graphs of feedback from the students, create a student, delete a student, reset the database and add a new admin user
* Students can view their previous mark checkpoints as well as adding a new checkpoint once the marked lab is done.
* Used HTML and PHP.
