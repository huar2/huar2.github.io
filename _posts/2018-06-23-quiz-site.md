**Summary**
* Developed a quiz website with two different user groups, player and admin.
* Admin users can create tournaments, after creating it the back-end fetches an API of quiz data and stores it into the database of the tournament.
* Players can answer questions from a tournament.
* If player exits the quiz halfway, the question is saved for them to complete later.
* Stores their score into the database and displays them to the player.
* Used Django as a web framework.
